#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software to ensure it is reliable, efficient, and scalable. Its importance in the technology industry lies in enabling the creation of high-quality software solutions that power modern applications such as cars, household devices, drive innovation, support business operations, and ensure technology systems are robust and adaptable to change.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three milestones include the development of programming languages Fortran, C. 
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Research to collect data
Design- create the roadmap using software design tools
Implementation- code and implement the design
Testing -checking whether the software has any errors or bugs to be solved
Deployment- releasing it to the market for real life usage
Maintainance- updating and fixing any buys available

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method is a step-by-step approach where one phase must be completed before moving to the next eg building a house.
Agile method is a flexible approach that focuses on developing software in small, frequent releases with continuous customer feedback eg building a mobile app such as game which would like customer feedback for changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Designs, writes, and maintains code to build software applications.
Ensures functionality and performance of the software.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software to identify bugs and ensure it meets quality standards.
Verifies that software works as intended across different scenarios.

Project Manager: Plans, coordinates, and oversees the software development process.
Manages timelines, resources, and ensures the project meets its goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments importance is to provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one place.
Enhance productivity and code quality with features like auto-completion and error checking.
Example: Visual Studio Code, Android Studio.
Version Control Systems importance include tracking and manage changes to code over time.
Facilitate collaboration and recovery of previous versions.
Example: Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing of requirements during the development process
Strategy: Use Agile methodology for flexibility and frequent feedback.

Complexity of systems being built.
Strategy: Implement modular design and use clear documentation.

Issues with debugging.
Strategy: Use robust testing frameworks and debugging tools eg visual studio debugger

Deadlines and Time Management
Strategy: Prioritize tasks, set realistic deadlines, and use project management tools.

Fatigue and lack of motivation
Strategy: Work in public spaces with other developers and also interact with them. Get a hobby to boost productivity.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions.
Importance: Ensures each part works correctly in isolation.

Integration Testing: Tests combined parts of the application to check interactions.
Importance: Identifies issues in the integration of different modules.

System Testing: Tests the complete system as a whole.
Importance: Validates overall functionality and performance against requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Tests the system from the user's perspective.
Importance: Confirms the software meets user needs and requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering involves designing and crafting the input queries given to AI models eg chatgpt, gemini to achieve desired outputs effectively. It includes specifying clear, concise, and contextually appropriate instructions or questions to guide the AI in generating useful responses.

Importance:
Improves Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses from AI models.
Enhances Usability: Ensures that the AI's output aligns with user needs and expectations.
Reduces Ambiguity: Minimizes misunderstandings and incorrect interpretations by providing clear instructions.
Optimizes Performance: Helps in leveraging the full capabilities of AI models for specific tasks or queries.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about potatoes.
Improved prompt: Give me a step by step recipe on how to make potato wedges.

The improved prompt helps the AI model to be able to provide accurate and precise data. The first prompt would make the AI give us alot of unimportant information about potatoes. The new prompt gives a clear and concise message that will enable us get accurate results.
